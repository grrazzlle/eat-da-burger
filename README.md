  ## Description

  Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. This app is a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

  ## Demo

  [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).
